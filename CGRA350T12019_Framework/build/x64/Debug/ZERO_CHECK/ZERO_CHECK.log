  Checking Build System
  CMake is re-running because C:/Users/GGPC/Documents/GitHub/CGRA350_project/CGRA350T12019_Framework/build/src/cgra/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
    the file 'C:/Users/GGPC/Documents/GitHub/CGRA350_project/CGRA350T12019_Framework/work/src/cgra/CMakeLists.txt'
    is newer than 'C:/Users/GGPC/Documents/GitHub/CGRA350_project/CGRA350T12019_Framework/build/src/cgra/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'
    result='-1'
  -- Selecting Windows SDK version 10.0.18362.0 to target Windows 10.0.19043.
  CMake Deprecation Warning at ext/glfw/CMakeLists.txt:8 (cmake_policy):
    The OLD behavior for policy CMP0042 will be removed from a future version
    of CMake.
  
    The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
    policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
    specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
    behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
